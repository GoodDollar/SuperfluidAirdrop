## How points for airdrop are calculated
Wallet points are  sum of:
- number of daily UBI claims on Celo since BLOCK_START
- sqrt of G$s streamed so far to GoodCollective pools. 

> Notice: Max stream rate for score is 73,000 G$ per day

> Notice: Wallet address must be a verified unique human being ie that passed face verification. (You can get verified on: https://gooddapp.org)

### Max score
If you claim every day for two years the max points you can get are 730.
If you stream every day 73K G$ for two years the max points you can get are 7300.

### Gas fees
We will subsidize gas fees on base so users can update their points at least once a month.
